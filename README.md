# Cardiovascular-Diseases-Risk-Prediction

Overview 

The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project is a data-driven initiative aimed at predicting the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on their medical records and lifestyle factors. This predictive model leverages a comprehensive dataset to calculate the probability of cardiovascular disease developing in a patient, providing valuable insights for early intervention and risk assessment.

Dataset

The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset with 19 relevant features for 30,8855 individuals, collected from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) by the CDC. These features include information on general health, medical history, lifestyle choices, and demographics. Here is a brief description of the key features:

General Health: General health condition of the patient.

Checkup: Date of the patient's last medical checkup.

Exercise: Whether the patient engages in regular exercise.

Heart Disease: Presence of existing heart disease in the patient.

Skin Cancer: Presence of skin cancer in the patient.

Other Cancer: Presence of other types of cancer in the patient.

Depression: Presence of depression in the patient.

Diabetes: Presence of diabetes in the patient.

Arthritis: Presence of arthritis in the patient.

Sex: Gender of the patient.

Age-Category: Age category of the patient.

BMI: Body Mass Index of the patient.

Smoking History: Patient's history of smoking.

Alcohol Consumption: Patient's alcohol consumption habits.

Fruit Consumption: Patient's consumption of fruits.

Green Vegetable Consumption: Patient's consumption of green vegetables.

Fried Potato Consumption: Patient's consumption of fried potatoes.

Height_(cm): Patient's height.

Weight_(kg): Patient's weight.

The Project Impact and Insights:

Through exploratory data analysis, this project has uncovered several key insights that contribute to our understanding of cardiovascular disease risk factors:

Age is a Crucial Factor: Individuals above the age of 55 are more prone to cardiovascular disease, with risk increasing significantly in patients aged 80 and above.

BMI Matters: Higher BMI is correlated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

Exercise and Age: While exercise generally reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, older patients who exercise extensively might face elevated risks due to increased heart strain.

Dietary Habits: Diet plays a significant role. Patients consuming more fruits and green vegetables exhibit lower susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, while those consuming fried potatoes are more prone.

Smoking History: Smoking history is a notable risk factor.

Medical History: Surprisingly, medical history concerning cancer, arthritis, diabetes, and depression showed no significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk.

Project Impact:

The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project has a substantial impact on healthcare by enabling healthcare professionals to:

Identify high-risk patients proactively.

Implement preventive measures.

Reduce the prevalence of cardiovascular disease

Conclusion

This project underscores the power of data-driven approaches in healthcare and their role in proactive patient management. By predicting cardiovascular disease risks and providing actionable insights, it contributes to the overall improvement of cardiovascular health in the population.

From the exploratory data analysis, we observed that the risk of cardiovascular disease increases with age, with individuals above 55 years being particularly prone to this condition. The highest number of cardiovascular disease cases was found in patients aged 80 and above. Additionally, higher BMI levels were associated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

Interestingly, older patients who exercise appeared to be more prone to cardiovascular disease, possibly due to the strain on the heart. Dietary habits also played a role, as patients who consumed larger quantities of fruits and vegetables had a lower risk, while those who consumed fried potatoes had a higher risk.

Furthermore, smoking or a history of smoking was linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Surprisingly, previous medical history related to cancer, arthritis, diabetes, or depression had no major effect on the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
